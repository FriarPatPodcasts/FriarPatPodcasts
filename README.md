- 👋 Hi, I’m Patrick M McCormick @FriarPatPodcasts
- 👀 I believe I created the first two Musical Podcasts in 2011 and 2012. I’m interested in creating many new creative podcasts and musical podcasts, MPODs.
- 🌱 I’m currently finishing a three episode series called "Thieves."
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with singer/songwriters that have well-produced original music of any genre.
- 📫 You can reach me at friar1944@yahoo.com
